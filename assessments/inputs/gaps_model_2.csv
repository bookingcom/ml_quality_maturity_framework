sub_characteristic,gap_value,reasoning
accuracy,no,The model is almost on par with the baseline with lower cost
effectiveness,small,"The model is fullon, but it was tested more than 6 months ago."
responsiveness,no,Latency/throughput requirements are known and met (or the model is offline)
usability,no,The model is deployed in a discoverable serving system
cost_effectiveness,no,"The model is fullon: not applicable, gains are larger than model's costs"
efficiency,no,"Basic model operations are automated, inference is optimized"
availability,no,The model is deployed in a discoverable serving system
resilience,no,There are at most 1 system failure per quarter
adaptability,small,The model is partially adaptable
